# poliastro validation

This repository holds validation cases against similar poliastro software.
Several alternatives are available:

1. Vallado: a collection of routines published in the book "Fundamentals of
   Astrodynamcis and Applications", by David A.Vallado. Software has been
   coded in different programming languages and can be found in [Celestrack
   webpage](https://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.php).

2. Orekit: this software is open-source and coded in Java. However, it has a
   Python wrapper, which makes it ideal for validation testing cases since it is
   very similar to poliastro. Official web page is hosted
   [here](https://www.orekit.org/).

3. GMAT: it is an open-source NASA software which stands for General Mission
   Analysis Tool. Its source code is written in C++ and makes use of OpenGL for
   visualization purposes. Official web page is hosted
   [here](https://gmat.atlassian.net/wiki/home).

4. AGI-STK: the reference software in the industry which stands for System Tool
   Kit. Although it is extremely advance and powerful from the point of view of
   orbital mechanics, its non open-source nature and the fact that only runs in
   Windows OS, are disadvantages for validation testing purposes. Official web
   page is hosted [here](https://gmat.atlassian.net/wiki/home).
